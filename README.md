CS 230 – Software Design Portfolio Reflection
Client: The Gaming Room – Draw It or Lose It
Project Summary
The client, The Gaming Room, wanted to expand their existing Android-based game, Draw It or Lose It, to operate across multiple platforms. The game is a multiplayer application where teams compete to guess images rendered from a stock image library. My task was to design a scalable, secure, and distributed system architecture that would allow the game to run across various operating environments while supporting multiple concurrent users.
The software requirements included multi-user functionality, distributed communication between platforms, efficient memory and storage management for large image files, and strong security measures to protect user data.
What I Did Well
One of my strongest areas in developing this documentation was clearly analyzing and comparing operating platforms and architectural approaches. I effectively explained why a Linux-based cloud server would be the most appropriate solution and supported that recommendation with reasoning related to scalability, cost efficiency, distributed systems, and security. I also did well organizing technical concepts such as memory management, storage management, and distributed architecture into structured, client-friendly explanations.
What Was Helpful About the Design Process
Working through the design document before writing code was extremely helpful. It forced me to think through system architecture, scalability, and security requirements before implementation. Instead of jumping directly into development, I had to consider how components interact, how data is stored, and how the system would behave under load. This structured planning reduces errors and improves long-term maintainability.
What I Would Revise
If I could revise one part of my work, I would further refine the domain model and possibly add more visual diagrams to support the written explanations. While my explanations were clear, visual representations of system architecture and component relationships would make the document even stronger and more professional.
Interpreting User Needs
I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on scalability, reliability, and cross-platform compatibility. Since the client wanted to expand beyond Android, I designed the system using a cloud-based, distributed architecture that supports web access across multiple operating systems. Considering the user’s needs is critical because software must solve the client’s actual business problem—not just function technically. Ignoring user requirements can result in systems that are inefficient, difficult to scale, or misaligned with business goals.
My Approach to Software Design
When designing this software, I approached it systematically:
Analyzed business and technical requirements
Compared operating platforms
Evaluated memory and storage implications
Considered distributed systems and security
Recommended an architecture based on scalability and long-term sustainability
In the future, I will continue using structured design documents before implementation. I would also incorporate more modeling tools, such as UML diagrams and cloud architecture diagrams, to visually support system planning. Taking a thoughtful architectural approach ensures that applications are not only functional but also secure, scalable, and maintainable.
